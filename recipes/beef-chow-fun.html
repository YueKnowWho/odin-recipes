        <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cut and wash beef</strong></li>
                    <p>Cut your flank steak <strong>(10 oz)</strong> into medium or 1/4-inch slices.</p>
                <li><strong>Prepare vegetables</strong></li>
                    <p>Peel and thinly slice the yellow onion into 1/4-inch thickness.</p>

                    <p>Wash the bean sprouts <strong>(1 handful)</strong>, drain, and set aside.</p>
                        
                    <p>Wash and chop the scallions <strong>(3 stems)</strong> into 1-inch long pieces. Use all of the green onions and separate the white parts from the green parts.</p>
                <li><strong>Make beef marinade</strong></li>
                    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, mix the baking soda <strong>(1 tsp)</strong>, cornstarch <strong>(1 tbsp)</strong>, oyster sauce <strong>(1 tbsp)</strong>, soy sauce <strong>(1 tbsp)</strong>, tamari <strong>(1 tsp)</strong>, white pepper <strong>(0.25 tsp)</strong>, water <strong>(2 tbsp)</strong>, cooking wine <strong>(1 tsp)</strong>, sugar <strong>(1 tsp)</strong>, and mix until everything is incorporated and smooth.</p>
                <li><strong>Mix beef into marinade</strong></li>
                    <p>Drain the meat from the water bath, squeeze out the excess water.</p>

                    <p>Add the meat into the marinade and mix until the meat is fully coated in the marinade and set it aside.</p>
                <li><strong>Prepare rice noodles</strong></li>
                    <p>Prepare the rice noodles <strong>(1 lb)</strong> by separating the noodles if you see them stuck together. The best way to do this is to gently massage them between your hand and a cutting board. If there are a few noodles that are stubborn, you can peel them apart.</p>
                <li><strong>Make chow fun sauce</strong></li>
                    <p>In a small bowl, mix tamari <strong>(1 tsp)</strong>, soy sauce <strong>(1 tbsp)</strong>, and oyster sauce <strong>(1 tbsp)</strong>. Once mixed, set it aside.</p>
                <li><strong>Stir fry beef</strong></li>
                        <p>Add cooking oil <strong>(1 tbsp)</strong> to the marinated beef to seal the juices in the beef.</p>

                        <p>Heat up the wok to the highest heat for about 1 minute and a half before adding more cooking oil <strong>(3 tbsp)</strong>. This may vary depending on your cookware.</p>
                        
                        <p>Heat the oil for 30 seconds or until the oil starts to ripple.</p>
                        
                        <p>Add your beef and cook for 40 to 60 seconds on high heat. It's fine if it's a little red because we will continue to cook it later.</p>
                        
                        <p>Remove the beef from the wok and set it aside. You can strain the excess oil from the beef at this time.</p>
                <li><strong>Stir fry vegetables and noodles</strong></li>
                    <p>Wipe down the wok before cooking the other ingredients.</p>

                    <p>Add a small amount of oil to the wok. You won't need a lot because the rice noodles already have some oil.</p>
                        
                    <p>Fry the yellow onion and the white parts of the scallions for 20 to 30 seconds or until fragrant.</p>
                        
                    <p>Add the rice noodles <strong>(1 lb)</strong>. Take your time stirring them because they will need some time to loosen up in the wok. If you over stir them, they can break.</p>
                        
                    <p>If your noodles are sticking to the wok, take them out and set aside. Scrub the wok clean, heat it back up to start frying again and add the noodles back.</p>
                        
                    <p> Cook the noodles for two minutes or until golden brown. Another way to know when they're ready is when you can smell them.</p>
                        
                    <p>Add the sauce and cook for 1 minute until the noodles are well coated in the sauce. At this point, if you feel that the noodles are not dark enough, you can add more dark soy sauce.</p>
                        
                    <p>Add the green parts of the scallion and bean sprouts.</p>
                        
                    <p>Cook for 30 to 45 seconds before adding in the beef.</p>
                <li><strong>Add beef back</strong></li>
                    <p>Add the beef and mix. Let everything cook together for 1 more minute. Turn off the heat and add the sesame oil <strong>(1 tsp)</strong>.</p>
                <li><strong>Taste test and plate</strong></li>
                    <p>Taste to adjust the flavors and plate once it's to your taste! This is usually served at the center of the table and everyone can take the amount they want.</p>
